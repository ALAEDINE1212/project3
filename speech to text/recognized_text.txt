welcome to the athletic Cafe podcast with me are you a Kimberly refinia is having an incredible season at Barcelona after being pushed towards the new camp exit during the summer the Brazilian has grown into one of hansi Flick's most important players so how has hernia reinvented himself to become one of Europe's most effective players here with us today we have the Athletics Thomas Hill Lopez Montero and Phil hey is with us as well now Phil look hernia was involved into of bosses goals as they came from behind to beat Athletico 42 on the weekend he's now listen to this tally got incredible 45 gold contributions that's 45 gold contributions in 42 appearances in all competitions I know you saw him at Leeds but this development appears is extraordinary it is I have been badgering you to do this for the way partly because I did enjoy watching him so much it leads but partly because this season has been exceptional that is he starting to move out on his own or certainly into a teeny tiny group of you know properly world-class players who are out in front of the rest I mean when he was in the Premier League you could definitely see the roots of the player he is now and the talent in the player was very obvious as was the sort of in a self-confidence that he has so I went to say that he's changed much or change the great deal stylistically he's he's quite a classic Winger you know a bit like something you know 1990s with definite you know 21st century traits as well but when he gets the ball particularly if the space around him is is instinct is to tear away with it it's it reminds me a bit of like 100 for a retro listeners you know how to spell will absolutely burn it and and his pace is so extremely trying to contain him is is pretty thankless and I read a piece of a week or so back which was in an interview the athletic did with Robert Perez next Arsenal player and he was picking out his favorite forwards and his favorite her weight forward and Wingers and refining actually made the cut and is observation of him and he clearly loves Raphine it was that in his words he has something different and it's touching Superior to other players it's so clean and you really can't see that I mean those shorts from distance but like the one against in the Champions League a couple of weeks back a little bit of trademark for my I saw that for the first time and with leads to be everything in 2020 that was his first Premier League goal and you always feel like the goalkeeper should get there because he is so far out but the hit is just too sweet it is like but it said to to clean and I think is they would say in the US he goes down as a clutch player that was certainly true that leads and it's true at Barcelona but I think it's true and even greater degree in Spain and that's what I'd say he's enhanced in the time since he moved on from England in the Premier League his ability to decide the game timing begin edit properly world class all Ballon d'Or level going to win the Champions League this season and also La Liga he has to be one of the names of the top of that list for sure I would think that he's going to be in the conversation one way or the other boss I have it all in front of them they could do the treble between the Copa del Rey the La Liga and the champions league and I think they've got a series of actually doing that probably come down to to injuries and and Real Madrid as much as anything in the but his numbers are so good across goals and an assist that he will be part of the Reckoning and he will attract some votes whether or not Bossa and do what they want to do and finish with a raft of of medals he just is that good and you know the weekend you were talking about and against Atletico Madrid is just a kind of standard Saturday or Sunday for him at the moment this is what he's doing every time and as I say that I think is is where you've seen the enhancement in him is to be able to carry play carry that pressure consistently and also to do a club like Barcelona with it just is nowhere to hide yeah for sure at Thomas you know we've spoken so much about buses financial situation but you know how much credit does have any himself deserve for for backing himself you know I mentioned it at the intro there was a chance this was a player that could be sold in the summer yeah for sure and not just this summer largely because that's the nature of their financial situation ruffini arrives from Leeds in 2022 for 55 million pounds in principle which is no small fee for bastard in The Current financial situation remember that's the Summer where they're pulling levers to registered players basically selling off stakes in their future business for up front cash hits and there's been plenty of times as mentioned himself when he's had these moments of self-doubt he talks about feeling pressure that made him think of leaving seeing reports of the club wanted to sell him and that kind of been easy for him to to deal with I think a lot of far less than him would have would have crumbled on that pressure a lot of buses in the last couple of years have crumbled under that kind of pressure that kind of noise so to rise above that and to become you know not just a key player but an absolute leader in this team are Captain is voted for by his teammates it's it's in as we were saying that it's Ballon d'Or film that he's showing at the moment it's really interesting because I remember when he was at Leeds and there were a whole heap of Premier League clubs that are not Global clubs actually that was touted to sort of take his signature going to Barcelona in a situation whereby Barcelona probably wasn't in their best financial situation this is someone I think and I don't know if you saw it leads that Thomas is a deluded to that there's a leadership something there there's something there that this is a guy that wants to prove himself at the top stage yeah that's summer 2022 is probably worth revisiting just for some background leads to stayed up by the skin of the teeth in the Premier League they've been lucky to be quite honest but he was still Cut Above by a distance and you will start to look at him and think why on Earth is he in a relegation battle is too good for this and he was always leaving that someone I mean there was never any question that he was he was going to go I still had a close look at him but never got close to deal and Chelsea were ready to play at least really like the Chelsea deal because they knew that Chelsea would be good for the money and it was like the safe transfer for them the unsafe or the ludicrously complex transfer was Barcelona's as Thomas was explaining what a mess like pulling levers trying to free up money as they do it wasn't even really that clear if they could afford them but from a long way out if he was only interested in that movie it was basically Barcelona and nothing else it had to be them who is no sporting director at Barca and was altered with them so we can speculate as to you know how much he influenced rufina wanting to go there above all other options but because he was dead set at least basically had to show extreme patients to get it done and so much so that there was a penalty clause in the end which said that if bastard didn't pay as agreed on time whatever it was I think they were on the hook for about 10 million euros extra Play On Top of the feet but what was quite fascinating is that at the time Barcelona won in particular great shape they'd finished a long way behind Real Madrid and obviously they were pretty chaotic and off the pitch so he's kind of become two things at bars at that not ideal standing start but also the slightly weird relationship we had with the club and and Savvy and initially as well the times when it felt like he was definitely headed for a partner of ways and he has said you know sins that the relationship with them Chevy was okay it was fine even though he felt like he was always going to get substituted after and 60 minutes and it was a really unhappy time for Java you just seemed totally sick the place by the time he left but I mean as it stands they just aren't many more valuable players anywhere at the moment he's as well I think to bosses and let me know at the moment which is really quite so something I just thinking Thomas you know you think about the Brazilians that played in the Champions League name of Ronaldo the list goes on this guy has more goals in a single season in the competition than any of those massive massive names I mean this is the top Echelon of Brazilian player here yeah definitely and what's interesting a different type of Brazilian player as well he mentioned that great I think that's that's really something that comes across in Ruffin is game the the athleticism that kind of you know banging down doors what whatever the situation I think if you compare him to to past Bossa Brazilian players he's not really a kind of Neymar or Ronaldinho he's not a trickster he's he's more direct than that and in many ways he's you know even more effective at times he's he's got that brilliant goal record this season he's freeing up space for your mother as well he's combining well we'll have enough ski he kind of does it all and and yeah I mean it's it's impressive because when he first joined you maybe didn't expect him to enter that kind of Pantheon of Barca Brazil he's got that Brazilian Flair I think from time to time but I don't remember how many times I just keep watching I'm just like it just scores bangers just pure bangers and it's like sometimes when you need it the most and that kind of attitude for me is the kind of attitude that can lift a team in essence as well yeah he's definitely box office and I think in that sense he's quite quintessentially Brazilian he's also got the favors background as in the which you know yeah related really really good narrative there was a great a Great Piece that heated on the players Tribune and about his growing up and and what it was like from him in Brazil which can open your eyes to to how how it was and what he had to to cope with I still have any rain sold them to come to the Premier League he was he was less than 20 million pounds and it was funny because people around rain at no stage would except that they might you know they might have dropped the ballet by doing that you know pretty much all it took for for all of us to say you know wait a minute this looks good and so is there still have a transfer and and like a lot of Brazilians are the best Brazilians he seems to have total faith in how high can climb you know which seems to be pretty much right to the top and there is that great I mean it leads the leadership aspect you saw through the we played you know if you needed something you would make it happen Norwich in his last season which people should take a look at if they haven't it was like it a Hillary point where where leads for desperate and it wasn't like he was perfect I mean him and Marcelo bielsa came to blows shortly before Bill she was sacked and I have to see The Narrative of him going to Barcelona was up and running months before they actually happened it was quite a Relentless driving I'm not sure how helpful it was but he's massively respected at least and and they were considered him to be you know one of the best players who have passed through the club certainly one of the most naturally gifted okay well Jordan is now we have our Barcelona writer last Saturday who was there to witness the incredible game in Madrid last weekend by the way but also can you explain the importance of her opinion this season for Barcelona he's been so Dynamic for this team and he's changed a lot yeah I mean I think that's nobody was expecting more after all the rumors of Barcelona wanting to sell him on summer transfer window and yeah I think the thing is the perfect example for the youngsters on the team that are rushing to have their chance to succeed inside the the team he's 28 years old he had three opportunities of being the player he is now and he had to wait first because there was it in his turn on TV relaxed Usman in the right winger so it was he was just waiting and then they told and when he thought that he had to change finally to shine at 16 years old player juice are you okay then player I can understand but then 16 years old player now we know who is la mega mall but we didn't know that he was going to to to be as such a good player as he is now 1 or 2 years ago so I think for him that was not easy but he took the best solution that he could take it he's going to be an instructional player for the team I can tell that so I still also in the Midfield and I think he found the resolution and the respect for for the teammates who were watching him not just give up on the situation and say okay I'm going to leave and that's it but just finding a solution for him yeah yeah what you said that was really interesting about him I'm switching position because more often than not now I'm watching him drift attacking positions and now that's where the goal scoring is coming from in a whole different light switching positions but also coming in is that something so I'll just hit my mic cuz I'm so excited is that is that something that Hanson flick you feel tactically has worked with him on yeah I have the thing that has found a place for him on the team even if I think that I think probably playing as a (inaudible) Barcelona really is his team because if you say a seasons ago this is a player that look like he was on his way out this is a real show of confidence to say like you know I'm here to stand if (inaudible) but I think that he was chosen for something and I think he is like the balance between the youngsters and the other players on the dressing room because it's a really am balanced Squad I would say in terms of age because you have players on the 13th and you have player on the under 20 years old and that are really important for the team so I think he can relate to the younger players but he has (inaudible) I think it was during the summer when he was with Brazil when everybody must know was kind of saying that he was the player to to sell during the summer I think one supports are asking to sign a real Madrid shirt and he was like no no you have to respect that I'm from Barcelona Barcelona Club and I think the video went by and maybe I can see but it's something that really cares for the players also and I think the fact that in the first or second game in Madrid this season the whole crowd was singing Captain to him make him feel more important you know actually allows him to get more involved in the girls I've seen so many opportunities where the mouse just looks up finds it's quite a nice little combination Barcelona rebuilding their yeah definitely I mean I think if if many buses have got their wishes in the summer then maybe we would have been seeing a Williams talks about that I think that was maybe part of the reason he felt sort of disrespected at times it was well but yeah Ravinia in your mouth have formed a pretty handy partnership themselves I really recommend reading at peace from earlier this season about how flickers kind of varies from position to positions sometimes he's on the left sometimes he's through the middle sometimes he's combining with Lewandowski but definitely one constant I think this season has been his runs behind the goal I always come back to is that late late winner at Benfica in the league phase where you know deep into stoppage time after 90 minutes for Phineas still running to chase that is all up front it seems he was getting some criticism from supporters for not scoring enough and it's true that 13 goals may be isn't as many as you'd expect from from him this season if it even if he is just 17 years old whereas refinia is that consistent goal scorer that yeah maybe does allow your mouth to to do his thing as well yeah Phil you know I think he's 28 at the moment you think this is a good two three seasons still left in him with this young Barcelona team 11 Dulce obviously I mean much older so in terms of emerging leaders and already seems like one now he could be a real Staple in this in this team and hopefully lead this team to we're handed flick wants to take them very much so I think Thomas touched on someone we should talk about a little bit which is that you know this this season has been a big shot in the arm for them flicks reputation is a coach I think and just to take Ravinia in isolation his his physical prowess is one of his biggest strengths by a male and it makes absolutely no sense not to exploit that you know if you watch back through any of his is better performances in England of which there were many it was it was the hard running combined with the the flare that did it you know the pace and the athleticism that made him such a threat and he is pretty young at 27 he should be starting to Peak no and looks like he's I need some comments from Romario recently down in the Brazilian press which was saying that if Bill Brazil have any chance or they're the only chance at the World Cup next year and if they are going to go far enough or win it and then they have to take Neymar and Neymar has to shine but I'm almost done to feel like refinia is everybody's key to them having a real opportunity in the USA he needs to be he needs to be there and he needs to be informed and if he is then you know Head to Head can we say to a certain degree that this is one of the more positive signings in most recent times but also a player that probably wouldn't have been here left Administration not too long ago yeah but I think that the really bad financial situation for Barcelona is the key that we are seeing the team that we are seeing because in which scenario would players like that are under 18 have a chance to play for the first time and have an important they have so probably it was something it was a little bit of luck for the youngsters and they are proving that they have the quality to do it but yeah I think add Ravinia has been one of the recent most important signings for for Barcelona for sure if we don't have to we have to take into account period join the team in 2019 but yeah in the recent years I would say he has proven to be one of the most important because who wanted to tell him but now he's pulling that he deserves to be to be here and we will see that the same thing happens to Frankie young which seems to be starting to play really good again for the Ballon d'Or if if Boston winning the champions league potentially the trouble this season surely man he's got to be the guy or I mean could you meet me Brazil has been waiting for Avalon door for like a long time for a long time and everybody was expected to be released and everybody's talking about if you think about that when you go it's crazy to think about it but yeah I think he has proven that he had to be on the list at least I don't know if he is going to to win it I think that season and since we are coming from Rodrigo winning the last year maybe it could be they haven't been to the semifinals since the defeat to Liverpool in 2000 and 2019 they have to be considered what's favorites to win this competition it just seems like a team that seems to be gathering momentum at this moment in time I mean to say that they are the favorites not by much I don't think I think it's fairly large I don't think I've said this on previous podcast I don't think anyone will need enough has been said about enter over in Italy they they're having an incredibly strong season in there the 100% know exactly what they are and are supposed to be on the inside so they are a threat I think quick quiet threat but the only there in recent famous as well Real Madrid obviously and PSG certainly laterally of probably looked like the best side in it actually or the most accomplished saying it but I think with PSG is the question of whether or not it's going to run out for them at some stage whereas Barcelona have been really strong in a very very competitive La Liga this season you know right right in the mix in what would have been an easy title race to to drop out of and also showed a good amount of backbone against Benfica when they were they were up against it in the first leg so I can I can actually see them winning all three of the trophies the the info you know Copa del Rey and and the league of two and the biggest threat and he said this at the top is is going to be the death resources and injuries and losing Mark saddle for two months which they have over the weekend is not at all ideal and the key players later and you know I've got to stay fit but if they do I'm not instantly picking out a team who are going to beat them in this Champions League I think it is theirs for the taking yeah actually getting really showed something special with let me in your mouth and how influential is on this team but also have been as you said also just so potent so yeah interesting time and also Barca this season Thomas you know if you look at that Athletico match it's not the first time this is sort of crawled their way back from you know a losing position which you know it's a real sense of Champions but I'm just thinking about at the El Clasico and the level of competitiveness that is there right now and do we see a shift in that in that quality in comparison to I guess the Guardiola Mourinho is yeah I think it's hard to get back up to the Guardiola that we had arguably you know the best two players in the history of football playing on on either side but certainly it's become incredibly competitive I think they're probably was a bit of a worry that post Ronaldo post Messi have been really interesting this season I mean they've both gone fastest way and and in a big way which is interesting in itself because usually you expect these Madrid sizes to to turn up for those those huge classes but that's also Testament to flick and and what he's done and I'm sure from La liga's perspective I'm sure they'll be excitement at the fact that Madrid have a back pain this really star front three and Netflix has injected new life into a bar Society with one of the world's best young players in your mouth of the world's best young player and levandowski another great Ford line so yeah the meetings have become box office again and maybe that's not something that could always be said in the last couple of Seasons yeah that frontline's fascinating how does it compare do you think to that the front lines of the past you know if I get a message you've had Messi Suarez Neymar and 11 Dolly your mouth I mean it's potent it's getting the gold is it of legendary status yet I think that I think that's a bit of a stretch although obviously to another trouble then maybe we will have to consider them up there it's it's really interesting because you have a player like 110 there who actually at various points this season has been kind of questioned by by the fan base I think certainly by neutral observers maybe in patches where he's not scoring as much but he again he's kept up his his incredible scoring record as our play Michael Cox pointed out in his analysis of the Athletico game that 110 gold kind of comes out of nowhere that's a that's a classic Strikers finished to to drag his team back into it your mother perhaps interchange a bit more but I do think we need to to highlight lewandowski's role and we'll see I think it's hard to get up to you know the likes of Esso on the messy or MSN largely because both of those teams had had messy in them but it's something special that looks great and for sure I think the talent is there I think that he was in above the others you know I think at the best of senior your mouth let me ask you what would fit into a lot of very very you know Top Class Barcelona Barcelona lineups and but it seems to me that in terms of reputation for the down the line bars are reputation anyway it'll all come down to to what they what they win I mean I don't live in Spain and I'm not in the mix but I often wonder what it's like for Barcelona looking the whole of European cups that Real Madrid have got because even though the club seemed permanently so evenly matched and at the same kind of level and therefore with the same potential to to break in trophies in the way that they can and how much is the Mi out in front and in that respect a real house so I guess for this particular Varsity to resonate they they need to win the big trophies and they need to do the business in a season like this one where it's all in front of them thank you so much for your time and also thank you guys for watching as well be sure to like the video and also
