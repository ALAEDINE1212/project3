Faisal scores brace in Qatar U-17’s win over Mongolia

Qatar were made to work hard 
before securing a 2-0 win against 
Mongolia in their AFC U-17 Asian 
Cup 2025 Qualifiers Group F 
match at the Aspire in Doha 
yesterday. Zaid Faisal made a 
captain’s contribution, scoring 
a brace to give Qatar a winning 
start to their campaign.The 
forward opened the scoring in the 
18th minute but any perception 
of the floodgates opening were 
quickly diminished as Mongolia 
put on a resilient display. It took 
Qatar until six minutes from the 
end before they were able to add 
another through Faisal to confirm 
the three points. In another match 
yesterday, Japan thrashed Nepal 
9-2. Next up for Qatar will be 
Nepal tomorrow with Mongolia 
facing Japan.

Verratti salvages 
Arabi a point against 
Kuwait’s Qadsia

By Sports Reporter
Doha

Al  Arabi  were  held  to  a 

1-1  draw  by  Al  Qadsia  of 
Kuwait  in  the  opening 
match  of  the  Gulf  Club 
Champions League at the Al Thu-
mama Stadium yesterday.

Marco  Verratti  got  Al  Arabi  the 
equaliser  in  the  71st  minute  af-
ter Igor Rossi had put the Kuwaiti 
side ahead in the 56th minute. The 
Dream Team began their campaign 
in  the  regional  tournament  in  an 
attacking  mode,  with  most  of  the 
pressing coming from them in the 
early minutes of the match.

But  the  tides  appeared  to  be 
turning  gradually  in  Al  Qadsia’s 
favour as the match wore on, with 
their central midﬁ  elder Daniel Aji-
bola,  a  Nigerian  international  in 
particular, proving to be dangerous 
with  his  often  eff  ortless  incursion 
into  Al  Arabi’s  box,  which  caused 
some  headaches  for  the  Qatari 
side’s defence.

Rodri  Sanchez  missed  a  golden 
chance of putting Al Arabi in front 
in  the  25th  minutes  after  his  left-
footed  eff  ort,  following  his  bril-
liant move inside Al Qadsia’s ﬁ  nal 
third, went a bit wide off   the mark.
Al  Arabi  appeared  to  regain  the 
upper  hand  from  thereon  as  they 
launched  waves  of  relentless  at-
tacks on the Kuwaiti side’s defence 
but for all their eff  orts, the match 
was  stalemated  going  into  the 
break.

The hosts began the second half 
from  where  they  stopped,  with 

Sanchez  again  missing  a  sitter  in 
the  51st  minute  after  being  per-
fectly  set  up  by  Ahmed  Alaael-
din  to  the  disappointment  of  the 
bench and stands.

Five minutes later, Al Qadsia got 
the  opening  goal  through  Rossi  to 
the  consternation  of  the  vocifer-
ous Al Arabi supporters.

A stunned Al Arabi went to work 
immediately in search of an equal-
izer and their eff  orts were reward-
ed in the 71st minute when Verratti 
ﬁ  red  home  a  25-yard  thunderbolt 
of a shot following a brilliant pass 
by  Alaaeldin.  The  goal  was,  how-
ever,  contended  by  the  Kuwaitis, 
as  they  claimed  the  ball  was  out 
of  touchline  before  it  was  passed 
to  Alaaeldin.  But  after  a  lengthy 
VAR  check,  the  goal  was  allowed 
to stand.

Despite  Al  Arabi’s  attempt  at 
getting the win, especially in add-
ed  time,  Al  Qadsia’s  defence  en-
sured  that  the  spoils  were  evenly 
shared, with the game ending in a 
1-1 draw.

Al Arabi coach Anthony Hudson 
later said, “I am satisﬁ  ed with the 
performance  of  the  team  against 
Al  Qadsia  though  we  could  have 
achieved  a  better  result  than  a 
draw.”

Al Qadsia coach Zeljko Petrovic 
said: “I believe the draw in today’s 
match  was  fair.  We  faced  a  strong 
opponent, and the outcome of the 
game  was  realistic.  The  second 
group in the tournament is excel-
lent.  We  will  have  tough  matches 
ahead, but I believe the experience 
gained  from  these  tournaments  is 
what truly matters.”

with an eff  ort reminiscent of his strike against 
old club Borussia Dortmund two years ago that 
won Champions League goal of the season.

Savinho’s  chipped  cross  was  slightly  be-
hind the 24-year-old, who contorted his body 
to  strike  the  ball  martial  arts  style  and  ﬁ  re  it 
past  Vindahl.  Stones  nodded  in  a  vital  stop-
page  time  winner  against  Wolves  in  the  Pre-
mier League on Sunday and continued his hot 
streak  in  front  of  goal  with  a  looping  header 
from Nunes’ cross. 

Haaland  then  completed  a  three-goal  blitz 
in 11 minutes at the end of a scintillating City 
counter-attack.

Slick  passes  from  Rico  Lewis,  Foden  and 
Nunes teed up Haaland to slot home his 44th 
Champions League goal in just 42 appearances 
in the competition.

Guardiola could aff  ord the luxury of replac-
ing  his  star  number  nine,  along  with  Ilkay 
Gundogan  and  Bernardo  Silva  in  the  closing 
stages with City in the midst of a run of seven 
games in 21 days.

Nunes completed the rout from the penalty 

spot after he had been felled inside the area.

Victory  takes  City  onto  seven  points  from 
their opening three Champions League games, 
behind  only  Premier  League  rivals  Liverpool 
and Aston Villa.

NUNEZ EARNS LIVERPOOL 
NARROW WIN AT LEIPZIG
Liverpool’s Darwin Nunez took full advantage 
of a rare start with the winner in his side’s 1-0 
victory at RB Leipzig as their 100% start in the 
Champions League continued yesterday.

With Diogo Jota ruled out because of injury, 
Uruguayan  Nunez  got  his  chance  and  deliv-
ered in the 27th minute by poking home Mo-
hamed Salah’s header. It proved enough to se-
cure Liverpool’s sixth away win out of six in all 
competitions this season and maintain an ex-
cellent start to new manager Arne Slot’s reign.
Liverpool are second in the 36-team league 
phase with nine points, behind only Aston Vil-
la  on  goal  diff  erence.  Leipzig  twice  had  goals 
disallowed and wasted several other promising 
moments as their wait for a ﬁ  rst point goes on.

Barcelona  captain  Raphinha  scored  a 

hat-trick to lead them to a command-
ing 4-1 home victory over Bayern Mu-
nich  in  the  Champions  League  yes-
terday, ending a near decade-long winless run 
against the German powerhouses.

Raphinha’s  inspired  night  started  when  he 
gave Barca the lead a little over a minute after 
kick-off   as he received a ﬁ  ne pass through by 
midﬁ  elder Fermin Lopez, beat the off  side trap 
before rounding the onrushing Manuel Neuer 
and tapping into the empty net.

Harry Kane levelled the score with a volley 
in  the  18th  minute  but  Robert  Lewandowski 
put  the  home  side  back  in  front  in  the  36th 
minute  after  a  mistake  by  Bayern’s  defence 
and Raphinha extended Barca’s lead with two 
goals  from  quick  counter-attacks  either  side 
of  halftime.  Barca  are  ninth  in  the  Champi-
ons League standings on six points from three 
games  while  Bayern  are  23rd  on  three  points 
after a second consecutive defeat.

HAALAND BRACE 
Erling  Haaland’s  spectacular  acrobatic  eff  ort 
lit  up  Manchester  City’s  5-0  win  over  Sparta 
Prague to move into third place in the Cham-
pions League table.

The  Norwegian  scored  twice,  including  a 
backheel  at  shoulder  height,  as  City  ran  riot 
against  the  Czech  champions.  Phil  Foden, 
John Stones and Matheus Nunes were also on 
target  for  Pep  Guardiola’s  men,  who  remain 
unbeaten in all competitions this season.

Sparta  had  taken  four  points  from  their 
opening two Champions League games against 
Salzburg and Stuttgart, but City were a step up 
in class too far for the visitors.

Foden’s  struggle  for  form  and  ﬁ  tness  has 
compounded City’s injury problems with Ro-
dri and Kevin De Bruyne sidelined.

But there were encouraging signs for Guar-
diola  as,  restored  to  the  starting  line-up,  the 
England international drilled home the open-
ing goal after just three minutes.

Haaland  had  nine  eff  orts  on  goal  in  total 
but  was  frustrated  in  the  ﬁ  rst  half  as  Sparta 
refused  to  let  the  ﬂ  oodgates  open  before  the 
break. Peter Vindahl produced a stunning save 
low to his right to parry a powerful downward 
header from Haaland on 10 minutes.

Vindahl  also  denied  Foden,  while  Haaland 
had  another  towering  header  hacked  off    the 
line.

For  all  the  home  side’s  dominance,  Sparta 
would have levelled midway through the ﬁ  rst 
half  but  for  a  brilliant  save  from  Ederson  to 
turn behind Veljko Birmancevic’s strike on the 
counter-attack from a City corner.

Haaland  did  ﬁ  nally  deliver  City’s  second

Gambhir backs 
Rahul as NZ brace 
for trial by spin

‘I think he is batting very well and had a decent knock in Kanpur’

Reuters
Pune

India  head  coach  Gautam 

Gambhir backed KL Rahul to 
regain his batting form, while 
New  Zealand  prepared  for  a 
trial by spin in the second test be-
tween the sides beginning today.
India’s proud record of not los-
ing  a  single  Test  series  on  home 
soil since 2012 is on the line after 
New  Zealand  beat  them  by  eight 
wickets  in  the  series  opener  in 
Bengaluru.

The hosts were bundled out for 
46 in the ﬁ  rst innings and a vastly 
improved  462  in  the  second  was 
not  enough  to  prevent  New  Zea-
land  from  going  1-0  up  in  the 
three-test series.

Rahul,  who  was  trolled  on  so-
cial media after his scores of zero 
and  12  in  Bengaluru,  appears  to 
have  slipped  behind  Sarfaraz 
Khan  in  India’s  batting  pecking 
order.

Sarfaraz  smashed  a  rapid  150 
in  the  second  innings  to  justify 
his  selection  after  Shubman  Gill 
missed  the  match  with  a  stiff  
neck.

Gambhir conﬁ  rmed a ﬁ  t-again 
Gill  would  resume  his  place  but 
also  backed  Rahul,  who  smashed 
a half century against Bangladesh 
in  Kanpur  last  month,  to  come 
good.

“Social  media  does  not  mat-
ter  one  bit,”  former  India  opener 
Gambhir told reporters yesterday.

“What  the  team  management 
and  leadership  group  thinks  is 
very important.

“I think he is batting very well 
and had a decent knock in Kanpur 
on a diffi    cult wicket.

“I  am  sure  he  also  wants  to 
score big runs and he has the ca-
pability  of  scoring  runs.  That’s 
why  he  has  been  backed  by  the 
team...”

Given  the  presence  of  several 
left-handed  batters  in  the  New 
Zealand  lineup,  India  are  also 
considering  playing  off  -spinner 

Washington  Sundar,  the  coach 
added.

Gambhir  said  ﬁ  nalising  In-
dia’s  playing  XI,  which  would 
be revealed at today’s toss, was a 
“challenge”  as  well  as  indicative 
of the depth in the side.

He also praised India’s fearless 
batting in the second innings de-
spite the ﬁ  rst-innings collapse.

New  Zealand,  meanwhile,  ex-
pect  an  under-pressure  India  to 
revert to their traditional strength 
and  roll  out  a  turning  track  in 
Pune.

“We  had  a  brief  look  at  (the 
pitch)  yesterday,”  said  New  Zea-
land  all-rounder  Rachin  Ravin-
dra.

“It  deﬁ  nitely  looked  very  dry, 

very spin-friendly.

“It’s  something  we  thought 
they’d  do  after  that  test.  Hon-
estly,  we’ve  just  got  to  adapt  to 
what’s in front of us.

“For  us,  it’s  about  adapting  to 
what’s in front of us, making that 
early  read  and  hopefully  we  can 
make  those  changes  if  need  be,” 
Ravindra said.   

WORLD CUP QUALIFIER

Zimbabwe set T20I 
records in massive win

Harare

Sikandar  Raza  smashed 

an unbeaten 133 in 43 balls 
as  Zimbabwe  set  a  record 
innings  score  of  344  for 
four  in  their  T20  World  Cup  sub 
regional  Africa  qualiﬁ  er  against 
Gambia yesterday, and went on to 
claim the largest win in the format.
Raza launched 15 sixes in Nairobi 
to  score  his  maiden  T20  Interna-
tional century and take Zimbabwe 
to a new highest total in 20 overs, 
beating  the  previous  best  mark 
of  314  for  three  by  Nepal  against 
Mongolia last year.

They  bowled  The  Gambia  out 
for 54 in 14.4 overs, earning victo-
ry by 290 runs, again eclipsing the 
previous record winning margin of 
273 by Nepal against Mongolia.

Zimbabwe’s  27  sixes  in  the  in-
nings is also a record, edging Nepal 
by one.

Raza  reached  his  century  in  33 
deliveries  and  is  the  ﬁ  rst  player 
from Zimbabwe to make a ton in an 
international match in the format.
Openers Brian Bennett (50) and 

Tadiwanashe  Marumani  (62)  put 
on  98  for  the  ﬁ  rst  wicket  from 
34  balls,  before  Raza  and  Clive 
Madande (53 not out) smashed an 
unbeaten  141  in  40  deliveries  for 
the  ﬁ  fth  wicket.  No  bowler  was 
spared, but seamer Musa Jobarteh 
conceded  93  from  his  four  overs, 
an unwanted T20 record. 

Earlier 

yesterday,  Canter-
bury  opener  Chad  Bowes  broke 
the  record  for  the  fastest  double 
century  in  men’s  List  A  matches, 
reaching his double ton in 103 balls 
against Otago.

Asalanka stars as Sri Lanka beat 
West Indies in second ODI

Pallekele, Sri Lanka: Skipper 
Charith Asalanka struck an un-
beaten half-century as Sri Lanka 
defeated the West Indies by five 
wickets in the second one-day 
international yesterday to clinch 
the three-match series.
Chasing a tricky 190, Sri Lanka 
reached the target with 34 balls 
to spare at the Pallekele stadium, 
with Asalanka making an un-
beaten 62 off  61 balls.
The match was reduced to 
44-overs a side after the start 
was delayed by two hours be-
cause of rain.
Sri Lanka lost two early wickets 
but they were rescued by a third 
wicket stand of 62 between Nis-
han Madushka (38) and Sadeera 
Samarawickrama (38).
Asalanka then saw the team 
through with his doughty knock 
that included one six and seven 
fours.
He also brought up his 14th ODI 
half-century in the process and 
shared a stand of 55 with Janith 
Liyanage (24) for the fifth wicket.
This was Asalanka’s second 
consecutive half-century, follow-
ing his match-winning 77 in the 
first ODI.
The victory secured a 2-0 series 
win for the hosts, having won the 
opening game by five wickets on 
Sunday.
This was also the fifth successive 
bilateral ODI series win for Sri 
Lanka this year and the tenth 

BOTTOMLINE

consecutive home series victory.
“I am happy to score some runs 
and help the team win,” said 
Asalanka. “It’s been a dream 
run for us in the last couple of 
months. We want to keep win-
ning.”
The third and final match will 
be played at the same venue on 
Saturday.
“The series is lost but hopefully 
we can salvage some pride,” said 
West Indies captain Shai Hope.
“Our spinners need to take a leaf 
out of the Sri Lankan spinners’ 
books.”
Earlier, Sherfane Rutherford (80) 
shared a record 119-run partner-
ship for the ninth wicket with 
Gudakesh Motie (50 not out) to 
lift West Indies from a precarious 
58-8 after they were put in to bat 
in overcast conditions.
This was the highest ninth-wick-
et partnership for West Indies in 
one-day internationals, eclipsing 
the 85-run stand between Yan-
nic Cariah and Alzarri Joseph 
against New Zealand in Barba-
dos in 2022. Rutherford, dropped 
twice, hit four sixes and seven 
fours in his 82-ball knock.

Mehidy  Hasan  Miraz 
led a Bangladesh ﬁ  ght 
back  with  an  unbeat-
en 87 on the third day of the ﬁ  rst 
Test  against  South  Africa  yester-
day  to  turn  a  precarious  position 
into a tight contest.

Bangladesh  were  283  for  seven 
in their second innings when bad 
light brought play to a premature 
close  at  the  Sher-e-Bangla  Na-
tional  Cricket  Stadium,  leading 
South Africa by 81 runs with three 
wickets in hand.

Mehidy and Nayeem Hasan (16 
not out) will resume today, look-
ing to set South Africa an impos-
ing target on a variable pitch.

Bangladesh, who were 202 runs 
behind  the  visitors  after  the  ﬁ  rst 
innings, looked headed for an in-
nings defeat when they lost three 
early  wickets  yesterday,  slump-
ing  from  their  overnight  score  of 
101-3  to  112-6  as  Kagiso  Rabada 
grabbed  two  scalps  and  Keshav 
Maharaj  claimed  the  wicket  of 
Litton Das.

Rabada  had  opener  Mahmudul 
Hasan  Joy  caught  for  40  at  ﬁ  rst 
slip in the ﬁ  fth over of the day and 
then  two  balls  later  clean  bowled

Mushﬁ  qur Rahim. Litton Das was 
caught  behind  by  wicketkeeper 
Kyle  Verreynne  off    Maharaj  but 
the  original  appeal  was  turned 
down. South Africa captain Aiden 
Markram  almost  ran  out  of  time 
before requesting a review, which 
proved successful.

Mehidy  and  debutant  Jaker  Ali 
then  off  ered  stiff    resistance  with 
an  aggressive  approach  and  put 
on  a  138-run  partnership  for  the 
seventh wicket to see off   Bangla-

desh’s  deﬁ  cit  and  off  er  their  side 
hope of a turnabout in fortunes.

Mehidy  brought  up  his  half 
century  in  94  balls,  followed  by 
Jaker, who took 104 balls to get to 
50.  He  was  then  snagged  leg  be-
fore wicket to Maharaj for 58.

Rain halted play as South Africa 
were about to be off  ered the sec-
ond new ball and tea taken earlier 
than scheduled. 

When  they  returned  after  a 
lengthy  delay,  the  umpires  said 

the light was not good enough for 
South Africa to use their seamers.
Surprisingly,  the  visitors  con-
tinued with a spin attack, instead 
of  taking  the  bad  light,  allowing 
Bangladesh to add 16 runs in ﬁ ve 
overs before play was called off  .

BRIEF SCORES (Day 3)

Captain Stokes forecasts spin battle in Pakistan-England decider in Rawalpindi

the 

England  captain  Ben  Stokes 

series-de-
believes 
ciding  third  Test  against 
today 
Pakistan  starting 
will  boil  down  to  a  spin  battle  on 
a Rawalpindi pitch likely to favour 
slow bowlers.

Pakistan in Rawalpindi. (AFP)

England piled up 823-7 to thrash 
Pakistan by an innings on a lifeless 
Multan  pitch  in  the  ﬁ  rst  Test,  be-
fore  the  hosts  bounced  back  with 
a  152-run  win  on  a  recycled  and 
turning Multan track.

For the deciding match, Pakistan 
have kept the same combination of 
three  frontline  spinners  in  Sajid 
Khan, Noman Ali and Zahid Mah-
mood, with just one fast bowler in 

Aamer  Jamal.  Pakistan  have  used 
industrial  fans  and  heaters  to  dry 
the  Rawalpindi  pitch,  hoping  to 
replicate  their  spin-led  success  in 
Multan  which  ended  a  drought  of 
home wins stretching back to 2021.
Stokes said his three spinners in 
Jack  Leach,  Shoaib  Bashir  and  the 
recalled  Rehan  Ahmed  were  equal 
to the challenge.

“I’ll  be  backing  the  three  spin-
ners  that  we’ve  picked,”  Stokes 
told reporters after a training ses-
sion on the eve of the third and ﬁ  -
nal Test.

“We don’t know exactly how the 
wicket  will  play,  but  we’ve  taken 
as much information from it as we 
can.

“We  think  the  longer  the  game 
goes, the more spin will come into 
play.”

Pakistan  head  coach 

Jason 
Gillespie, the former Australia fast 
bowler, also expects the near-bald 
pitch  “to  favour  the  slower  bowl-
ers”.

The  toss  could  be  crucial,  with 
both teams looking to bat ﬁ  rst and 
maximise the impact of their spin-
ners on a deteriorating pitch.

Pakistan have performed poorly 
in all formats in the past year, los-
ing  2-0  in  a  home  Test  series  to 
Bangladesh and crashing out of the 
ODI and Twenty20 World Cups in 
the ﬁ  rst rounds.

A  series  victory  over  England 
would mark a stark change in for-
tunes.

“Over  the  last  few  years  Pa-
kistan’s  Test  cricket  hasn’t  been 
where we’d like it to be, so any win 
is a positive,” he said.

racers  testing  their  cars  for  readi-
ness, while the second day was al-
located to 4X4 freestyle racers. 

The  QRC  said  all  preparations 
have  been  completed  for  what  is 
expected to be an exceptional sea-
son.  The  new  season  is  featuring 
diverse  championships, 
intense 
competition, and eff  orts to attract 
a  larger  audience  of  motorsport 
enthusiasts. 

This aligns with the vision of the 
QRC Chairman HE Sheikh Khalid, 
who is dedicated to placing Qatar’s 
motorsport on the global map. 

Special attention has been given 
to the sports events calendar, aim-
ing to elevate the club, diversify its 
activities,  and  attract  more  par-
ticipants.  QRC  General  Manager 
Sheikh  Jabor  bin  Khalid  al-Thani 
said the club will feature the larg-
est number of events in its history, 
which  will  strengthen  QRC’s  sta-
tus  as  the  home  of  drag  racing  in 
the Middle East. 

“This year, the club is organising 

QRC General Manager Sheikh 
Jabor bin Khalid al-Thani 

two separate drag racing champi-
onships.  The  ﬁ  rst  is  the  Arabian 
Drag  Racing  League,  which  takes 
on  an  international  ﬂ  avour  and 
features participation from global 
champions of the sport,” he said. 

The  event  consists  of  six 
rounds, with the ﬁ  rst set for Janu-
ary 9 and 10, continuing until the 
ﬁ  nal round in mid-February. 

“The  second  championship  is 
the  Qatar  Drag  Racing  Champi-
onship,  consisting  of  ﬁ ve  rounds 
where  top  drag  racers  from  the 
Middle East compete. 

The  opening  round  will  take 
place  one  week  after  the  conclu-
sion  of  the  Arabian  Drag  Racing 
League, and it will conclude in the 
last  third  of  March  2025,”  Sheikh 
Jabor said. 

Additionally,  the  Qatar  Sand 
Drag  Competition  will  be  held  at 
the  Sealine  Sand  Track,  featur-
ing  ﬁ ve  rounds  starting  in  mid-

Action from last year’s Qatar 
Drift   Championship.

November and concluding in April 
2025.  Fans  of  freestyle  and  two-
wheel  stunts  will  enjoy  a  four-
round championship, and the club 
will  also  host  roll  races  and  open 
the  Motocross  track  for  enthusi-
asts. Reﬂ  ecting the growing global 
interest  in  electric  sports,  electric 
scooter  races  will  also  be  part  of 
the season, he said. 

The  season  will  also  witness 
several  electric  scooter  races,  re-
ﬂ  ecting  the  growing  global  inter-
est and signiﬁ  cant development in 
electric sports in recent times.

“We  made  sure  to  ﬁ nalise  the 
sports  events  calendar  for  the  new 

2024/2025  season  early  on  to  give 
racers  the  opportunity  to  prepare 
for  the  competitions,  as  we  are 
aiming  for  an  exceptional  season 
in every aspect. Our goal is to build 
an educated and aware community, 
and this approach reﬂ  ects the vision 
of  the  club’s  chairman,  His  Excel-
lency Sheikh Khalid bin Hamad al-
Thani, which is to continue building 
a youth base capable of steering Qa-
tar towards more achievements that 
represent  the  Gulf  region  and  Arab 
countries,”  said  the  QRC  general 
manager,  who  is  deeply  passionate 
about motorsport. 

“The  club  is  always  keen  to 

welcome  Gulf,  Arab,  and  foreign 
teams. Under the guidance of our 
club  chairman,  we  ensure  that 
these teams are provided with the 
right  conditions,  positively  im-
pacting  the  competitions.  This 
fact  is  well  recognized  by  every-
one, and it has set our club apart, 
making  it  a  shining  beacon  in  the 
history  of  this  sport  at  both  Gulf 
and international levels.”

He  added:  “In  addition  to  the 
races,  we  are  accustomed  to  or-
ganizing  events  and  exhibitions 
related to cars and motorcycles at 
the club, with a focus on support-
ing  young  people  and  enthusiasts 

of  excellence  and  creativity.  The 
goal is for the club to always serve 
as a platform that brings together 
car  and  bike  lovers  in  one  place 
along  with  companies  and  sup-
porting entities. 

“At the forefront of these events 
is  the  Qatar  Custom  Show,  which 
we  will  organise  for  the  12th  edi-
tion this season, from January 14th 
to 18th, 2025. We are also keen on 
hosting  several  gatherings  for  car 
owners  and  motorcycle  groups. 
As usual, there will also be special 
events to celebrate National Sport 
Day  and  the  National  Day  of  the 
State.”

Verstappen carries momentum 
back to a favourite track

Reuters
Mexico City

Max  Verstappen  has 

won  ﬁ ve  of  the  last 
six  grands  prix 
in 
Mexico  and  while 
Ferrari  will  fancy  their  chances 
this weekend, the Red Bull driver 
can take another big step towards 
a fourth Formula One title.
Verstappen  arrives  at 

the 
high-altitude  Hermanos  Rod-
riguez  circuit  57  points  clear  of 
McLaren’s  Lando  Norris  with 
ﬁ ve  rounds  remaining.  Norris 
described ﬁ  nishing fourth at last 
Sunday’s  US  Grand  Prix  in  Aus-
tin,  with  Verstappen  third,  as  a 
‘momentum  killer’  in  the  title 
battle  while  Red  Bull  saw  a  po-
tential turning point.

The  result  was  the  ﬁ  rst  time 
in ﬁ ve races that Verstappen had 
beaten Norris, and the Briton has 
yet  to  ﬁ  nish  higher  than  ﬁ  fth  in 
Mexico.  “We  have  historically 
done well here and I have always 
enjoyed  driving  at  this  track,” 

said  Verstappen  of  a  layout  that 
equals Austria’s Red Bull Ring as 
his most successful.

“We made some good steps in 
Austin  and  saw  some  promising 
improvements  with  the  car...it 
will  be  about  keeping  this  mo-
mentum  heading  forwards  and 
continuing to gain crucial points 
in the championship.”

The  constructors’  title  is  far 
more  open,  with  Ferrari  poised 
to  overtake  Red  Bull  for  second 
place  after  Charles  Leclerc  and 
Carlos Sainz ﬁ  nished one-two in 
Texas  to  reduce  the  gap  to  eight 
points.  The  pair  swept  the  front 
row  in  Mexico  last  year,  with 
Leclerc on pole.

Red  Bull  need  Sergio  Perez  to 
produce  the  points  in  his  home 
race and turn around a dire run of 
form that has seen him score only 
150 points to Verstappen’s 354.

Perez’s  tally  is  the  lowest  of 
any driver in the top four teams, 
with  nothing  better  than  sixth 
since  Miami  in  May  and  serious 
questions raised about his future 
despite  a  contract  extension  for 

2025  and  2026.  “The  important 
thing is to be able to shut out the 
noise  off    track  and  focus  on  the 
job in hand,” he said. “Ultimately 
the special thing for me would be 
to deliver another podium for my 
fans and my country, at home.”

With  Ferrari  looking  strong, 
and  Perez  needed  to  help  Ver-
stappen  in  his  battle  with  Nor-
ris, the Mexican’s hopes of a top 
three ﬁ  nish even if he recovers his 
form would seem unlikely.

Leclerc  and  Sainz  have  plenty 
to  be  optimistic  about  as  they 
chase  Ferrari’s  ﬁ  fth  win  of  the 
season.  Mercedes’  Lewis  Ham-
ilton  is  the  only  current  driver 
other  than  Verstappen  to  win  in 
Mexico,  the  seven-times  world 
champion  taking  his  2017  and 
2018  titles  there.  “After  a  diffi    -
cult  weekend  in  Austin,  we  have 
the  opportunity  to  bounce  back 
immediately,”  said  team  boss 
Toto Wolff  . “Our performance in 
Texas showed that there is inher-
ent  performance  in  the  car.  Our 
challenge  is  extracting  this  con-
sistently.”

assists) points Al

Shamal 93-70 at the 
Gharafa Stadium to

The 2024 Qatar National Sprint season concluded with the sixth and final round at the open parking lot 
beside Lusail Sports Arena. The popular series, organised by the Qatar Motor & Motorcycle Federation, 
saw Mansour Chebli of Lebanon leading the way in Class O1, with a 46.632-second lap in his Renault Clio, 
followed by Charbel Chebli and Qatar’s Ayad al-Okar. Class O2 saw Jad Alawar from Lebanon win in his 
EVO 8, while Amro Abdulla of Qatar came second in a Subaru. Class O3 was secured by Maher Serre in his 
Nissan 350Z, followed by Aleksandar Jokic and Paige De Jager. Qatar’s Nadim Ziade took the P1 class with a 
48.268-second lap, narrowly beating Mansour Chebli. In P2, Ziade continued to shine, securing another win 
with a time of 47.066. P3 was won by Francesco Fornaciari in a Lotus Exige. In the Women’s event, Melina 
Jokic secured a dominant win with a time of 53.711 seconds, ahead of De Jager and Nasmee’a Christian.

LeBron, Bronny make NBA history 
with father-son appearance
LeBron  and  Bronny  James 

made  NBA  history  yester-
day, becoming the ﬁ  rst fa-
ther-and-son  duo  to  play 
alongside  each  other  in  a  regular 
season  ﬁ  xture  as  the  Los  Ange-
les Lakers opened their campaign 
against  the  Minnesota  Timber-
wolves.  The  duo,  who  played  to-
gether brieﬂ y in a pre-season game 
earlier  this  month,  took  to  the 
court  together  late  in  the  second 
quarter  at  the  Crypto.com  Arena 
with  the  Lakers  leading  51-35.  An 
enormous  roar  went  up  from  the 
home crowd as the James duo were 
brought onto the court by coach J J 
Redick after the Lakers had surged 
into a double-digit lead.

In a perfectly scripted moment 
that  was  pure  Hollywood,  the 
James’  double-act  was  watched 
at courtside by Ken Griff  ey Sr and 
Ken  Griff  ey  Jr,  who  made  base-
ball  history  playing  for  the  Seat-
tle  Mariners  as  father  and  son  in 
1990-1991.  “We  made  history; 
now we get to watch history,” said

Tuesday’s  tip-off  .  Lakers  offi    cials 
had  been  coy  before  Tuesday’s 
season-opener  about  where  and 
when  LeBron  James  and  Bronny 
would play their ﬁ  rst regular sea-
son ﬁ  xture together.

However,  NBA  superstar  LeB-
ron  James,  who  turns  40  in  De-
cember,  admitted  in  pre-game 

remarks  that  he  could  scarcely 
contain  his  excitement  at  the 
prospect  of  realising  his  long-
cherished  dream  of  sharing  a 
court  with  his  son.  “Just  to  run 
out the tunnel knowing that he’ll 
be in uniform, run out the tunnel 
with  him,  see  him  warm  up,  and 
be  out  there  with  the  rest  of  my 
teammates,”  James  told  reporters 
during  a  morning  shoot-around 
on Tuesday.

Isle of Man TT Legend Hillier set for Qatar International Baja

By Sports Reporter
Doha

Isle  of  Man  TT  legend  James  Hillier 

is  heading  to  Doha  next  week  to  take 
part in the Qatar International Baja for 
the  ﬁ  rst  time.  The  three-day  event  is 
based  out  of  the  Lusail  Sports  Arena  and 
is  the  sixth  counting  round  towards  both 
the FIA World Baja Cup and the FIM Bajas 
World Cup. 

Bournemouth-based  Hillier,  39,  is  one 
of the world’s leading motorcycle road rac-
ers but he also took part in the Malles Moto 
section  of  the  2023  Dakar  Rally  without 
service support. Better known for his suc-
cesses at the Isle of Man TT and the North 
West 200, Hillier will face a totally diff  er-
ent  challenge  across  the  winding  gravel 
trails in Qatar, where outright speed needs 
to be combined with excellent navigational 
skills to achieve top results. 

Hillier began riding at the tender age of 
four  and  started  competing  in  trials  two 
years later. By the age of 17, the Hampshire 
rider had moved into the Virgin Mobile R6 
Cup, ﬁ  nishing fourth in 2004, before mov-

is currently seventh fastest rider of all time 
with  a  best  average  speed  of  132.414mph 
for the gruelling Mountain Course.

Hillier  also  has  nine  podiums  at  the 
North West 200, the highlight being a Su-
perstock  victory  in  2019  when  he  earned 
the  Man  of  the  Meeting  award.  He  is  also 
a top 10 ﬁ  nisher at the Macau Grand Prix. 

One  of  the  main  reasons  that  Hillier 
is  competing  in  Qatar  is  to  ﬁ  ne  tune  his 
off  -road  riding  and  navigational  skills  in 
advance of a second attempt at the Dakar 
Rally in Saudi Arabia with WTF Racing in 
January 2025. He has been tackling events 
such as the Setra Enduro during the course 
of the year to get his physical ﬁ  tness up to 
speed before the epic desert challenge.

The  Qatar  International  Baja  is  being 
organised by the Qatar Motor & Motorcy-
cle Federation (QMMF) and will run under 
the chairmanship of QMMF President Ab-
dulrahman al-Mannai, QMMF’s Executive 
Director Amro al-Hamad and board mem-

James  had  a  fascination  for  road  racing 
and  his  ﬁ  rst  appearance  at  the  world-fa-
mous TT meeting on the Isle of Man came 
in 2008. He competed in a pair of Super-
sport events for Jackson Racing, ﬁ  nishing 
a modest 19th and 17th on his debut. Lap-
ping  with  an  average  speed  in  excess  of 
119mph,  he  was  awarded  the  prestigious 
Newcomers’  Trophy  during  a  successful 
10-year  spell  with  the  Bournemouth  Ka-

2012 and then claimed a win in the Light-

Man United ‘will 
succeed sooner or 
later’: Mourinho

MOURINHO MANAGED UNITED BETWEEN 2016 AND 2018

AFP
Istanbul

Jose  Mourinho  says  struggling  Man-

chester United “will succeed sooner or 
later”  as  the  Fenerbahce  boss  prepares 
to take on his former club in the Europa 
League today. United manager Erik ten Hag is 
under pressure after a poor start to the season, 
which has included draws in their ﬁ  rst two Eu-
ropean  matches  –  against  Twente  and  Porto. 
But Mourinho, who has also managed a string 
of other high-proﬁ  le clubs including Chelsea, 
Real  Madrid  and  Tottenham,  said  United  had 
potential and he wants them to succeed.

“Maybe you English guys think I’m bluffi    ng, 
think I am playing mind games,” he said at his 
pre-match press conference. 

“I’m  not  playing  anything  –  they  have  a 
better  team  than  the  results  are  showing.  I 
studied  them  the  maximum  I  could  with  my 
staff   and my analysts. We watched everything 
in the Premier League, we watched everything 
in the two matches, Twente and Porto – there 
is work there. They will succeed sooner or lat-
er. Hopefully sooner and hopefully before one 
day I go back to the Premier League and they 
become  my  opponents.  At  this  moment  they 
are just my opponents for one match.”

Mourinho,  who  managed  United  between 
2016  and  2018,  winning  the  League  Cup  and 
Europa League, was asked why his former club 
had struggled over the past decade. “Honestly, 
I didn’t lose one minute thinking about it,” he 
said. “I wish the best to Man Utd since the mo-
ment I left.

“I left with a good feeling for the club, with 
a good feeling for the fans and I want the best 
for them, so if things are not going amazingly 
well for them it’s not something that makes me 
happy, but at the same time I have no time.”

The  61-year-old  suggested  that  during  his 
own reign at Old Traff  ord, the United hierar-
chy had not had the same patience they were 
showing towards Ten Hag. 

“What happened for sure, because it’s very 
objective,  is  that  they  kept  faith  with  the 
coach, they support the coach, who is staying 
season  after  season  and  that  means  stability, 
means trust and they are giving him conditions 
to keep developing his job,” he said. “That was 
a  diff  erence  in  relation  to  me  because  as  you 
know we won the Europa League, we ﬁ  nished 
second in the Premier League.”

coach in June following his sacking by Roma, 
said United would be at “maximum strength” 
for  the  match  in  Istanbul. “One  thing  are  the 
results that Manchester United are having and 
another thing is the potential of the team,” he 
said. “The potential of the team is high.”

the two biggest candidates to win the Europa 
League, I think it’s easy – Manchester United 
and Tottenham. The Premier League is a dif-
ferent level of quality, intensity, pace, tactical 
culture  –  a  diff  erent  level  of  everything.  To-
morrow,  I  think  we  are  going  to  play  against 
one of the two strongest teams.”

Emery already one of 
‘Villa’s greats’: McGinn

AFP
London

John  McGinn  says  Unai 

Emery has already cemented 
his  position  as  one  of  Aston 
Villa’s  greatest  managers  as 
the Spaniard celebrates two years in 
charge sitting atop the Champions 
League  table.  The  former  Arsenal 
boss,  who  was  appointed  on 
October 24, 2022, enjoyed an early 
anniversary  present  as  his  side 
went top of the Champions League 
table  with  a  2-0  win  over  Bologna 
at  Villa  Park  on  Tuesday  for  three 
wins out of three. 

They  are  also  off    to  their  best 
Premier  League  start  since  1998, 
with  ﬁ ve  wins  from  eight  games 
putting them fourth in the table.

It  is  an  extraordinary  turna-
round  for  the  Birmingham-based 
club,  who  were  deep  in  relegation 
trouble  when  Emery  took  over 
from Steven Gerrard. 

Villa  captain  McGinn  said  Em-
ery,  who  won  the  Europa  League 
three  times  with  Sevilla  and  once 
with Villarreal, had already proved 
himself among Villa’s elite.

“We  are  excited.  I  think  the 
manager  is  the  only  person  who 
does  not  get  excited,”  said  the 
Scotland international, who scored 
the  opening  goal  against  Bologna. 
“He just focuses his full energy all 
the  time,  like  he  says  every  single 
day he is that demanding on us. He 
does not let us take our foot off   the 
gas  so  we  can  use  energy  and  en-
thusiasm, the excitement we have, 

but  his  determination  and  inten-
sity is unmatched. No matter what 
happens  until  now  and  whenever 
he leaves – we hope it’s never – he 
will  certainly  go  down  as  one  of 
our club’s greatest managers.”

Villa 

followed  up  victories 
over  Young  Boys  and  Bayern  Mu-
nich  with  a  comfortable  win  over 
the  Serie  A  side  to  make  it  nine 
points  from  nine  in  the  Champi-
ons  League.  That  could  already 
be  enough  to  ensure  they  make  it 
through  to  the  play-off    round  of 
the  revamped  competition,  but 
their  eyes  are  on  ﬁ  nishing  in  the 
top eight and qualifying automati-
cally for the last 16.

“We  are  proud  of  where  we 
are,  top  of  the  league  table  at  the 
minute,”  McGinn  said  before  yes-
terday’s  ﬁ  xtures. “It  has  put  us  in 
a great position to go and kick on. 
Our aim is obviously to qualify ﬁ  rst 
and  foremost  for  the  next  round, 
but  if  we  can  take  it  into  the  top 
eight and carry this on it would be 
brilliant.”

Arteta counts cost of Arsenal 
win as injuries stack up

London:  Arsenal manager Mikel 
Arteta said his side’s growing 
injury list was becoming a worry 
after Riccardo Calafiori limped 
off  near the end of a scrappy 1-0 
win over Shakhtar Donetsk in the 
Champions League on Tuesday.
The London club started 
without captain and long-term 
absentee Martin Odegaard 
and forward Bukayo Saka and 
defender Calafiori now also looks 
like a doubt for Sunday’s crunch 
Premier League game against 
Liverpool after injuring his knee. 
Jurrien Timber is also struggling 
to be fit for the visit of Liverpool 
while central defender William 
Saliba will be missing after his red 
card in the defeat at Bournemouth 
at the weekend.

“With Riccy he had to come off  

because he felt something. I don’t 
know the extent of it but it’s not 
good news, it’s a bit of a worry,” 
Arteta, whose side have seven 
points from their opening three 
Champions League games, told 
reporters.

Arsenal fans will be happy to 
learn that full back Ben White’s 
substitution at halftime was not 
injury-related but because he had 
picked up a yellow card. “It was 
my decision to take him out. He 
had a yellow card, we have played 
enough with 10 men in recent 
periods,” Arteta said. “They had 
a lot of density, a lot of attacking 
players on that side and we didn’t 
want to take any chances.”

Arteta sounded pessimistic 
about the chances of Saka return-
ing against leaders Liverpool.

Ancelotti lauds ‘extraordinary’ Vinicius aft  er win against Dortmund

Reuters
Madrid

Real  Madrid  manager  Carlo 

Ancelotti  praised  the  ‘extraor-
dinary’  Vinicius  Jr  on  Tuesday 
after the Brazilian forward scored 
a second-half hat-trick to help them ﬁ  ght 
back from two goals down and thrash visi-
tors Borussia Dortmund 5-2 in the Cham-
pions League.

Ancelotti told a press conference he was 
convinced  that  the  24-year-old  Vinicius 
would  win  the  Ballon  d’Or  award  for  the 
best player in the world on Monday. 

“What I can say is that it’s rare to see a 
player who plays a second half like Vinicius 
did. And not because of the three goals but 
because  of  his  character;  he’s  extraordi-

nary,” Ancelotti said. “Vinicius is going to 
win (the Ballon d’Or), not for what he did 
tonight, but for what he did last year. These 
three  goals  are  already  going  to  count  for 
next year’s Ballon d’Or, that’s for sure. He 
is a player who gets whistled at because he 
can make a diff  erence.”

In a rematch of last season’s ﬁ  nal, Ance-
lotti said there was no panic in the chang-
ing room after Real went into the halftime 
break two goals down, and that his side had 
the maturity and experience to understand 
what they needed to do to come back. “We 
lived it calmly, calmly (over the break). We 
changed the system and came back playing 
more intensely,” Ancelotti said.

“Talking  about  scoring  three  goals 
might  have  seemed  utopian,  so  we  talked 
about small details like passing well, win-
ning duels... We had to win the dynamic of 

the  game  and  from  there  you  start  to  win 
the  game.  We  were  timid  in  the  ﬁ  rst  half, 
we  weren’t  intense  on  the  ball  and  in  the 
second half we did better with more qual-
ity, more pressure. It was the best second 
half of the season. 

“We  have  to  learn  from  what  we  did 
in the second half. The aim is to start the 
game and not wait for them to put two past 
us.  I  don’t  think  we  can  play  90  minutes 
with  the  intensity  of  the  second  half  but 
we can be more balanced.”

DORTMUND’S SAHIN TAKES BLAME 
FOR DEFENSIVE CHANGES IN LOSS
Meanwhile,  Dortmund  manager  Nuri  Sa-
hin took the blame for the loss, saying that 
his decision to reinforce his defence while 
leading 2-0 had an impact in their ﬁ  rst loss 
in the competition.

Dortmund went into Tuesday’s game on 
the  back  of  two  consecutive  wins  to  start 
the  Champions  League  season  but  were 
thrashed  by  Real  Madrid.  The  home  side 
scored ﬁ ve goals following Sahin’s decision 
to replace scorers Donyell Malen and Jamie 
Bynoe-Gittens  with  defender  Waldemar 
Anton and holding midﬁ  elder Pascal Gross 
early in the second half.

“It’s not easy to explain, of course. We, 
who  I  thought  played  well  with  the  ball, 
really had a lot of solutions. The boys did 
well, scored two goals and then went into 
halftime  and  we  knew  it  would  be  very 
long.  The  second  half  very,  very  long,” 
Sahin  said.  “We  noticed  in  the  second 
half  that  we  were  being  pushed  back,  we 
had  defensive  problems  and  I  thought  we 
should  go  to  the  three-man  defence,  and 
that didn’t work out for us.”
